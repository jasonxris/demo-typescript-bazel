# CPP Example - Hello World

This example will showcase how to build C++ code in stages. These examples have the very basics of Bazel.

### Stage 1

The first stage is really simple and shows you how to compile a binary with a single source file.

### Stage 2

The second stage will showcase how to build an application with multiple source and header files, separated in a library and a binary.

### Stage 3

The third stage showcases how to link multiple build directories by building multiple libraries in different packages and then connecting it up with the main application.
