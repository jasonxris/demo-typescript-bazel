# CPP Example - Lots O' Files

This example has lots of files. Use the generator shell script to generate a new file system which works with Bazel. This example should primarily be used for stress testing the bazel language server to ensure that it runs fast with very large file systems.

```
./scripts/generator.py <level_count> <packages_per_level>
```
